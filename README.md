For those of you who want a catch-all tracker for various Palia tasks, I thought I would share a blank copy of the tracker I use! 
It lists all Bundles and what is required to complete each one
It lists all bugs and fish and where to find them and how to get them
It lists which bugs drop which flower seeds
The Gardening tab details my favorite garden layouts with profit in mind
It gives a quick checklist for furniture sets so you can easily tell which you've collected all and which you've crafted all
