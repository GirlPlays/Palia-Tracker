For those of you who want a catch-all tracker for various Palia tasks, I thought I would share a blank copy of the tracker I use!<br>
It lists all Bundles and what is required to complete each one<br>
It lists all bugs and fish and where to find them and how to get them<br>
It lists which bugs drop which flower seeds<br>
The Gardening tab details my favorite garden layouts with profit in mind<br>
It gives a quick checklist for furniture sets so you can easily tell which you've collected all and which you've crafted all
